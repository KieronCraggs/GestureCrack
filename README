README

This is a simple script to find the pattern lock code on an Android Device, it was created for a test on Mobile Forensics which was part of my degree.

It works by opening a gesture.key file supplied using the -f flag or a raw text hash provided by the -r flag which is compared to a rainbow table of all patterns.

You do not need to download the rainbow table on its own, simply download the entire repo and run the script.


USAGE

python gesturecrack.py -f /path/to/gesture.key
python gesturecrack.py -r 8e7e00c0bd5ce227f7be204c8b7c159669c776d4

ISSUES
Why didn't you do x,y or z?
*I'm rubbish at Python
*I didn't have long to do it
*I wanted to keep it simple

FUTURE
I would like to do some GUI stuff in Python at some point so this would probably be the ideal candidate.
